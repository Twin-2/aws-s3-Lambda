# aws-s3-Lambda

Lambda function to use with AWS S3.

## How to use this Lambda

This Lambda is meant to listen for uploadsto an S3 bucket and then output that object to a new S3 Bucket.

## Issues

I struggled finding the corrent URI/reference to the image that was uploaded to the first bucket so that I could pass it to the second bucket.
